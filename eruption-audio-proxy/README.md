## eruption-audio-proxy - Audio proxy daemon for the Eruption Linux user-mode driver

A daemon that reports the state of audio devices like the master volume and the muted state, and delivers an
audio stream to the `Eruption` daemon where it can be processed. E.g.: for consumption by audio visualizer plugins.
Additionally the `eruption-audio-proxy` can play back sound effects, triggered by `Eruption`.
